# LeetCode-problem-215
I have solved the LeetCode problem of finding the kth largest element in an integer array using a min-heap data structure. While this can easily be done using sorting, the challenge lies in solving it without sorting. By utilizing a priority queue, I efficiently maintained the k largest elements, allowing me to retrieve the kth largest element.
